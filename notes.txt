A. Functional
- Used PixiJS
- It is a game, so it is as useful as a game can be
- Uses AABB collision detection.  Expands on AABB to determine which side of the collision occurred on and implements forces using normalized vector math and linear momentum.
- There are no JavaScript errors
- Uses two JSON files to read and parse data relating to the sprites which are implemented and changed based on interaction in game.

B. Design & Interaction
- Please retro graphic design following Arkanoid themes
- Everthing is well labeled
- No instructions are required, the game was designed in such a way that anyone should figure it out after the first or second play.  A user cannot generate an error in the game as the user doesn't provide any input other than mouse movement and left-click to fire the first projectile
- It works well on any screen that can support 800x600 or higher resolutions.

C. Media
- In the breakout directory there are 64 images that were acquired from ImagineLabs under the Creative Commons Zero license.  This license allows the re-use of the images without attribution, but the included license file states "without alteration".  Since I'm not a legal expert and the images (though they are large when opened as images) are already web optimized I opted not to resize them.  The 64 images are less than 1 Mb all together.
- There is sound.
- Fonts, graphics, spritesheets and sounds have all been replaced.

D. HTML/CSS
- The page passes HTML5 validation without errors.
- The page passes CSS validation without errors.
- There are only three properties that are changed with CSS therefore I don't believe it justifies having it's own file.  These three lines are in the game.html file.
- There is no HTML other than the skeleton for the file, hence there are no semantic styles used.  The entire HTML file, including definitions, imports and styles is only 32 lines of code.

E. Code Conventions
- No vars are used.
- There was no dom traversal outside of PixiJS hence no selectors were used.
- There are only two blocks of code (2 function calls of about 20 lines) that are similar (not the same), but they cannot be seperated from the functions where they are located because they cross reference other local variables.  The one also uses calculations as part of the input conditions to the function call while the other does not.
- The entire program consists of 6 files
	- 3x JavaScript
	- 2x JSON
	- 1x HTML
- All variable and function names begin with a lower case letter.
- All code is well commented
- All console.log() calls are commented
