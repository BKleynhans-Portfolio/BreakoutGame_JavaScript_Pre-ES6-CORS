# Recreation of the classic Breakout/Arkanoid game
This was created before we started using ES6 classes and consists of two large and one smaller JavaScript files.

For this project I used PixiJS with an implementation of AABB collision detection.  I use two JSON files to read and parse data relating to the sprites which are implemented and changed based on interaction in game.

This program needs to be run on a server environment to satisfy the CORS requirement.
